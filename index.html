    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are  to be disaplyed  on screen ,paper  , or in other media</li><br>
        <li><span class="li-strike">Css is not necessary</span> <span class="li-bg"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li><br>
        <li class="li-italic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul class="letter-spacing">
        <li>Inline - by using  the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using  style element in the head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most commmon way to add  CSS ,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However , <span class="li-bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID , on the otherhand ,applies a style to unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
<br><br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range  of elements on a web page .Once an element has been targeted, a style or a set of styles  can be applied  to the element.<br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target  elements to which a style should be applied.<br><br>
